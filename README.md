# Pyber_Analysis

#Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis was to find out pertinent data regarding ride-sharing statistics relating specifically to city type. Students learned how to use pandas and matplotlib in order to find historical data to gain a better understanding on ride sharing prices in suburban, urban, and rural city types. Specifically, I learned how to use groupby(), count(), pivot(), and resample functions. Also, I was able to make and format dataframes and linecharts within pandas and matplotlib, respectively.

#Results:

##Urban
Urban had the most number of rides with 1625 total rides being 68.42% of total rides. Urban cities had the most drivers with 2,405 drivers being 80.89% of total drivers. Urban citites had the highest total fares with $39,854.38 being 62.72%. The average fare for urban cities was the lowest out of the city types being $24.53. The average fare per driver was the lowest for urban cities as well at $16.57. 

##Surburban

Suburban cities had 625 total rides being 26.32% of total rides. Suburban cities had 490 drivers being 16.48% of total drivers. Suburban fares accounted for $19356.33 being 30.46%. The average fare for suburban cities was $24.53. The average fare per driver for suburban cities was $39.50. 

##Rural

Rural had the least number of rides with 125 total rides being 5.26% of total rides. Rural cities had the least drivers with 78 drivers being 2.62% of total drivers. Rural citites had the lowest total fares with $4,327.93 being 6.81. The average fare for rural cities was the highest out of the city types being $34.62. The average fare per driver was the highest for rural cities as well at $55.49. 

#Summary:

Omar and I would recommend to the CEO to focus on developing the urban capibilities of our ridesharing apps. It has the highest total revenue with exponential room for growth. While we are scaling towards gaining a larger market share of riders, it is imperative we do not focus on rural cities because of its lack of need and usability due a lack of consistent supply of customers and drivers. Suburban areas account for a significant share of the customer base; therefore, we should keep them within our operation, while continuing to focus on Urban cities.
